<h1>Margot slade Attempts poetry
  </h1>
 <p>
   
  <p> up in a tree a squirrel senses a bee, 
  a dog walks with zest, my day has just begun. though my head is hung, I am full of wonder, I think of all that I see.
  and throughout my hardships i try my best, with agile feet, the ring of thunder
  extemporizing the journey as i walk, i paint with swift movements. 
  Art means I musnt always talk, unlike poetry. <p/>
